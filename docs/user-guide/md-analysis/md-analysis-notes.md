# Analysis of MD Trajectories

[MD-Task](https://md-task.readthedocs.io/en/latest/home.html)

From the documentation:

>MD-TASK consists of a suite of Python scripts that have been developed to analyze molecular dynamics trajectories.

## RMSD Analysis

This uses the MDAnalysis package.

See [this Colab notebook](https://chem-workflows.com/articles/2021/09/04/brief-introduction-to-molecular-dynamics-analysis-with-mdanalysis/) for how to color protein by B-factor after RMSD analysis.
