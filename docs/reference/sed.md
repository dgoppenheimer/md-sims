# Using `sed`, the <u>*S*</u>tream <u>*Ed*</u>itor

## Introduction

Like `AWK` and `grep`, `sed` is a command line utility that can read and process text files. Each of these utilities can use regular expressions (`regex`) to search through text files to find matching patterns. While searching, `sed` makes only 1 pass over a text file. This makes it efficient, but `sed` cannot look backward or forward in the file for pattern matches.

For the definitive guide on using `sed`, see [sed, a stream editor](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html).

## Basic Syntax

## Advanced Usage

In this section, I'll introduce additional useful syntax for `sed`. This is not necessarily "advanced" syntax, but just more advanced than the basic syntax introduced above.
