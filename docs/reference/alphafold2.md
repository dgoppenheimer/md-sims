# AlphaFold2

## Jupyter Notebooks using AlphaFold2

[ColabFold: AlphaFold2 using MMseqs2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/AlphaFold2.ipynb)  
[AlphaFold2_advanced](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sokrypton/ColabFold/blob/main/beta/AlphaFold2_advanced.ipynb) This notebook has been incorporated into the previous notebook.  


Use ColabFold to predict structure of protein from genomics/metagenomics  
Use ML to identify/predict active site  
Use ML to identify potential substrates  

[Targeting allosteric regulation of cancer metabolism](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-00997-6) cancer cells have metabolic reprogramming, which can be targets. Suggests that ML and MD to identify possible allosteric sites
