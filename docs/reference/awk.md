# AWK

## Introduction

AWK is abbreviated from the names of the original program authors â€“ Alfred V. Aho, Peter J. Weinberger, and Brian W. Kernighan.

`AWK` is often referred to as a command line tool to search and modify text files, but it is actually a programming language that enables the user to write small programs that search for specific text using `regex`, and perform operations on the matching text. Because it is a scripting language, `AWK` is powerful and flexible, allowing you to do almost anything to a text file.

The definitive guide for using `AWK` is the [GNU AWK User's Guide](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html).
