# Notes on course title

I want to use this for a Quest II course submission. Since there is an AI initiative on campus, there is a need for AI-related courses to facilitate student interest in this topic. Several of the approaches used in this course make use of AI, so I want to include AI in the title.

However, I want to be careful that the title does not imply that the course will teach student how to create machine learning models, or teach the theory of AI, but just use the AI/ML models created by others.

I can't really use the "*A Practical Approach*" subheading as it is part of a series of books going back decades at Oxford University Press.

## draft titles

- Practical Molecular Dynamics
- **AI in Drug Discovery**
- Using AI in Drug Discovery
- Leveraging AI in Drug Discovery
- Application of AI in Drug Discovery
- **An AI Approach to Drug Discovery**
- Drug Discovery Using AI
- **Practical Molecular Dynamics -- an AI Approach**
- Molecular Dynamics in Drug Discovery

### Subtitles

- a hands-on approach
- a hands-on approach using AI

The *An AI Approach to Drug Discovery* title is the best so far. It is not perfect in that it implies more AI than the course will deliver. However, the course summary will very explicitly list what the course is and is not.

The *Practical Molecular Dynamics* title is not perfect. The course will only use GROMACS and relatively small, soluble proteins. A course focusing on using molecular dynamics simulations would ideally need to at least touch on NAMD, OpenMM, CHARMM, and AMBER, and explain force fields.
