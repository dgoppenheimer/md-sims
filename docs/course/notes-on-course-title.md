# Notes on course title

I want to use this for a Quest II course submission. Since there is an AI initiative on campus, there is a need for AI-related courses to facilitate student interest in this topic. Several of the approaches used in this course make use of AI, so I want to include AI in the title.

However, I want to be careful that the title does not imply that the course will teach student how to create machine learning models, or teach the theory of AI, but just use the AI/ML models created by others.

I can't really use the "*A Practical Approach*" subheading as it is part of a series of books going back decades at Oxford University Press.

## draft titles

- AI in Drug Discovery
- Using AI in Drug Discovery
- Leveraging AI in Drug Discovery
- Application of AI in Drug Discovery
- **An AI Approach to Drug Discovery**
- Drug Discovery Using AI

The *An AI Approach to Drug Discovery* title is the best so far. 





In this course we will use
