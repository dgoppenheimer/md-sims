>deciphering functional mechanisms of proteins and other biomolecules, in uncovering the structural basis for disease, and in the design and optimization of small molecules, peptides, and proteins.  
...  
An atomic-level structure is tremendously helpful and typically generates substantial insight about how the biomolecule functions.  
These simulations can capture a wide variety of important biomolecular processes, including conformational change, ligand binding, and protein folding, revealing the positions of all the atoms at femtosecond temporal resolution. Importantly, such simulations can also predict how biomolecules will respond--at an atomic level--to perturbations such as mutation, phosphorylation, protonation, or the addition or removal of a ligand. 
...
simulations can generate new experimentally testable hypotheses and thus influence further experimental work.
